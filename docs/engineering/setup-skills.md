# setup-skills

## What it does

`setup-skills` answers three questions about one repo: where issues live, what the triage labels are called, and where the domain docs sit. It records the answers as markdown files under `docs/agents/`.

Those files are the only thing that varies between repos. The skills themselves are identical everywhere. They read `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` at run time and do what it says. That is why the set is not tied to GitHub, and why you never edit a skill file to point it at another tracker. Invoking it with "link the skills to a custom issue tracker" works with anything you can connect to programmatically, with no changes to the skills.

It is a prompt-driven skill, not a deterministic script. It reads your `git remote`, `CLAUDE.md` and `GLOSSARY.md`, proposes what it found, and waits for you to confirm before it writes anything.

## When to reach for it

You invoke this by typing `/setup-skills`; the [agent](../ai-coding-terms.md#agent) won't reach for it on its own. Its metadata marks it non-invokable on purpose, so no other skill can fire it for you.

Reach for it once per repo, before the first use of any other engineering skill. If [triage](triage.md), [to-spec](to-spec.md), [to-issue](to-issue.md) or [wayfinder](wayfinder.md) start guessing where your issues go, or apply labels your tracker doesn't have, this repo has not been set up yet. You can run it in a repo halfway through a project. The skill reads what is already there, so no earlier work is lost.

## Prerequisites

It writes into the repo you run it in:

| It writes | Where |
| --- | --- |
| `issue-tracker.md` | `docs/agents/` |
| `domain.md` | `docs/agents/` |
| `triage-labels.md` | `docs/agents/`, only when the `triage` skill is installed |
| An `## Agent skills` block | whichever of `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` already exists |

You commit all of it as markdown. There is no user-level or global mode. The config lives in the repo, so every repo gets its own copy.

## The three decisions

It starts each section with the recommended answer, and skips any question its exploration already answered. Most runs need only two confirmations.

| Decision | What it proposes | When it asks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Issue tracker** | the one matching your `git remote` | always, because this is the one real choice |
| **Triage labels** | keep the five canonical names (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`) | only if the `triage` skill is installed |
| **Domain docs** | single-context: one `GLOSSARY.md` plus `docs/adr/` at the root | only if it spots monorepo signals, and then it offers a multi-context `GLOSSARY-MAP.md` |

The tracker options:

| Option | Where issues live | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **GitHub** | the repo's GitHub Issues | the `gh` CLI |
| **GitLab** | the repo's GitLab Issues | the `glab` CLI |
| **Local markdown** | files under `.scratch/<feature>/` in this repo | nothing, not even a remote |
| **Other** | wherever you say | one paragraph from you describing the workflow |

The first three ship as templates in the skill and work out of the box. Local markdown is a full option, not a fallback. The skill supports a solo project with no remote. One caveat: don't use local markdown if you use GitHub. They are alternatives, so pick one.

"Other" is a full option too. It is how Jira, Linear, Azure DevOps and Beads all work. You describe the workflow, the skill records your prose in `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`, and the downstream skills follow the prose.

## It's working if

- `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` and `docs/agents/domain.md` exist, plus `triage-labels.md` if `triage` is installed.
- An `## Agent skills` section appears in the instruction file your harness reads, with a one-line summary pointing at each of those files.
- The tracker it proposed matches the remote you use, and the label strings match labels that exist in your tracker.
- Afterwards, `/to-issue` publishes without asking you where issues live, and `/triage` applies labels rather than inventing them.
- Nothing in the skill files themselves changed. If setup edited a `SKILL.md`, something went wrong.

## Where it fits

`setup-skills` is the **run-once setup** for the engineering flow, the precondition everything else assumes rather than a step in the chain. Its neighbours are its readers: [triage](triage.md), which applies the label vocabulary written here; [to-spec](to-spec.md) and [to-issue](to-issue.md), which publish into the tracker named here; and [wayfinder](wayfinder.md), which reads the "Wayfinding operations" section of the same tracker file to learn how to store maps and child [issues](../ai-coding-terms.md#issue). [domain-modeling](domain-modeling.md) later fills in the domain-doc layout that setup records. It creates `GLOSSARY.md` and ADRs only when you resolve a term or decision, so a repo with no domain docs after setup is normal. For which skill to reach for next, [which-skill](which-skill.md) routes the whole set.
